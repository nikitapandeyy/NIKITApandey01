# NIKITA PANDEY

## About Me
I am a highly motivated college student pursuing a BTech degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I am seeking a challenging and dynamic role in a company where I can utilize my skills and positive attitude to contribute to projects, learn and grow as a professional, and further the mission of the company. My passion lies in machine learning and data science, and I have hands-on experience in using TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and OpenCV.

## Projects
### Image to Music through Pixel Mapping
**Tech Stack:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Collab
- Utilized advanced image processing techniques to convert hues to a NumPy array.
- Applied mathematical mapping functions to translate the array into musical octaves, scales, and frequencies.
- The result was the generation of unique musical compositions using algorithmically generated data.

### Food Delivery Time Prediction using Python
**Tech Stack:** Pandas, Numpy, Plotly express, Sklearn, Keras
- Utilizing Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) neural networks, I developed a predictive model to estimate food delivery times with high accuracy.
- The model was trained on a large dataset using Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Keras, and scikit-learn.
- The model was able to make accurate predictions, improving food delivery times and customer service.
