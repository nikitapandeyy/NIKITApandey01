Hi there! My name is NIKITA PANDEY and I am a A highly motivated college student seeking a challenging and dynamic role in a company where I can utilize my skills and attitude to contribute to projects, learn and grow as a professional, and further the mission of the company. I am passionate about machine learning and data science and have experience in  TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib,Seaborn, OpenCV .

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
- <b> Image to music through Pixel mapping</b>: <br>Tech Stack: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Collab<br>
-   ◦: Utilized advanced image processing techniques to convert hues to a NumPy array.<br>
-    ◦ : applied mathematical mapping functions to translate the array into musical octaves, scales, and frequencies.<br>
-    ◦ : process resulted in the generation of unique musical compositions using algorithmically generated data. 
- <b> Food delivery Time prediction using python</b>:<br>Tech stack: Pandas, Numpy, Plotly express, Sklearn, Keras<br>
-  ◦ : Utilizing Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) neural networks, I developed a predictive model to estimate food delivery times with high accuracy.<br>   
-  ◦ : The model was trained on a large dataset using Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Keras, and scikit-learn. <br>
-  ◦ : The model was able to learn from the dataset and    make accurate predictions which helped in delivering food on time and providing better customer service.
